# 🌡️ Temperature Sensor Response Time Comparison in LabVIEW

## 📘 Project Brief

> Design a LabVIEW program that compares the speed of response of the LM35 temperature sensor installed on the sensor board with the thermistor supplied to you. This is an NTC, 22k, (Farnell:1672386). Your system should use the thermistor in a potential divider. The program should display both the voltage produced by the sensor on pins 1 of J2 and the thermistor voltage. It should then ask the user to hold both sensors and display the changing output voltages on a graph. Your program should indicate which sensor reading started to rise first and the rate of change of each voltage.

## 📖 Overview

This project involves designing a **LabVIEW** program to compare the **response speed** of two temperature sensors:

- 🔧 **LM35 temperature sensor** (mounted on the sensor board)
- 🌡️ **NTC Thermistor** (22k, Farnell: 1672386)

The goal is to measure and analyze how quickly each sensor responds to a change in temperature (e.g., when held by a user) by evaluating their voltage outputs and rates of change.
