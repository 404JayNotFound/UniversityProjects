# Oscilloscope Project

This repository serves as a comprehensive digital archive encompassing all the essential design artifacts and supporting documentation generated throughout the development lifecycle of a USB-based oscilloscope. Originating as a university electronics project, this endeavor involved a detailed exploration and adaptation of the commercially available Velleman EDU PC Oscilloscope kit. The core processing unit of this custom oscilloscope design is the Microchip PIC18F24J50 microcontroller, a versatile component chosen for its USB capabilities and suitability for embedded control applications.
