# üöÄ **Ultrasonic Radar System**

## üß≠ **Overview**
The **Ultrasonic Radar System** is a real-time system designed to simulate radar functionality using an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller. By integrating an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, a **micro servo motor**, and an **I2C LCD display**, the system is capable of scanning a 180¬∞ range, measuring distances to objects, and displaying the results in real-time.

The system operates by rotating the ultrasonic sensor using the micro servo, emitting ultrasonic pulses to detect nearby objects, and calculating distances using the time-of-flight method. This data is then displayed on an LCD and can be transmitted via serial communication for external visualization.

This project is an excellent platform for understanding principles such as **distance measurement**, **servo control**, and **sensor integration**. It can be applied in various fields including robotics, IoT, and automation.

## üåü **Features**
- **Distance Measurement**: 
  - Uses the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to measure distances with high accuracy. The sensor operates on the principle of emitting an ultrasonic wave and measuring the time it takes to reflect back after hitting an object.
  
- **Servo-Controlled Scanning**:
  - The **micro servo (9g)** is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor across a 180¬∞ horizontal arc, allowing the system to scan its environment in a manner similar to a radar system.
  
- **Proximity Alerts**: 
  - An **LED** indicator is triggered when objects are detected within a user-defined proximity threshold, which is helpful for immediate feedback in object detection applications.
  
- **Real-Time Display**:
  - The distance readings, along with the corresponding scanning angle, are shown on an **I2C LCD (16x2)** display. This minimizes wiring complexity and provides real-time data feedback.
  
- **Compact Design**:
  - The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing it to be easily assembled using an **Arduino shield** for streamlined hardware integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Hardware Components**
This project uses the following components to build the radar system:

- **Arduino Uno**:
  - The **ATmega328P** microcontroller on the **Arduino Uno** is responsible for controlling the servo, measuring distances with the ultrasonic sensor, processing data, and driving the display and LED indicators. The Uno operates at 16 MHz and provides adequate digital I/O and PWM pins for the system.
  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**:
  - The **HC-SR04** is a widely used ultrasonic sensor that emits a high-frequency sound wave and measures the time it takes for the wave to reflect off an object. The time delay is used to calculate the distance to the object. It provides measurements within the range of 2 cm to 400 cm, with a typical accuracy of ¬±3 mm.
  
- **Micro Servo (9g)**:
  - The **micro servo** is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor between 0¬∞ and 180¬∞ with high precision. The servo is controlled using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** signals from the Arduino, which defines its position within the rotational range.
  
- **I2C LCD (16x2)**:
  - The **I2C LCD** is a 16x2 character display that shows the current distance measurement and scanning angle. Using the I2C communication protocol, this module reduces wiring complexity and only requires two pins (SDA and SCL) for data transfer.
  
- **LED**:
  - The **LED** serves as an alert system, turning on when the system detects an object within a predefined proximity threshold. This provides immediate visual feedback for detection events.
  
- **Potentiometer** (Optional):
  - A **potentiometer** can be used to adjust the proximity threshold dynamically, or to fine-tune the servo‚Äôs speed or other parameters.
  
- **Push Button** (Optional):
  - A **push button** could be used for additional user input, such as manually resetting the system, pausing the scan, or switching modes.
