# FPGA GameSystem

Design a digital system to implement a video game using the Basys3. The board has a VGA output which will connect to a monitor for the signal display.  Use the following PMODs from digitlentinc :  Pmod KYPD: 16-button Keypad as an input device , Pmod SF3: 32 MB Serial NOR Flash as EEPROM memory to hold user settings , Pmod JSTK2: Two-axis Joystick. It is not necessary to design the actual game. The goal is to design a hardware platform that that would allow different games to be created.
